    <string name="hitchcock">Hitchcock</string>
    <string name="hitchcock_text">Hitchcock is chef Brendan McGill’s ode to the land he’s worked since moving to Bainbridge Island years ago. He opened the restaurant in 2010, and though the initial buzz has died down, there are still outstanding things happening here. “Microseasonal” in its approach and therefore obsessive about its preservation techniques, Hitchcock features local produce, seafood, and meat, flawlessly executed. The wine-pairing program is strong, too.</string>
    <string name="harvest_beat_text">Critics of veganism rarely associate a word like “fun” with the plant-based cuisine, but Harvest Beat — spiritual successor to Sutra, RIP — is joyous, exuding a respect for its ingredients and their provenance as well as a relaxed vibe that’s far more hippie than hip. It wouldn’t amount to a hill of heirloom beans if the food weren’t spot on, but the creative, ever-changing tasting menu experience here will inspire Meatless Mondays for months to come.</string>

(His perfect paella is only available during Sunday brunch.) Up to 18 courses incorporate a staggering amount of unusual fermented and wild-foraged native foods, each dish composed with nuance, whether prawn and Pacific Northwest berry ceviche, uni and lettuce “tacos,” or Dungeness crab stout bun with cured egg yolk. The setting is luxurious, beautiful plants and tiny lights dangling from every surface, and service is carefully coordinated by co-owner Alia Rocher to ensure diners learn all the details behind the cavalcade of impeccable plates.</string>
